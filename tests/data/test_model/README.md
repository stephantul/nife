# SentenceTransformer

This is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model trained. It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 3-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for semantic textual similarity, semantic search, paraphrase mining, text classification, clustering, and more.

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Sentence Transformers)

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Download from the ðŸ¤— Hub
model = SentenceTransformer("sentence_transformers_model_id")
# Run inference
sentences = [
    'The weather is lovely today.',
    "It's so sunny outside!",
    'He drove to the stadium.',
]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# [3, 3]

# Get the similarity scores for the embeddings
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[1.0000, 0.9842, 1.0000],
#         [0.9842, 1.0000, 0.9842],
#         [1.0000, 0.9842, 1.0000]])
```
